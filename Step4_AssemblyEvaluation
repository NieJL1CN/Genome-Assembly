# Step 4
# After Ragtag, the chromosome scaled sequences were assembled.
# Some evaluation of the assembly is needed.
# Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO) is good in evaluating
# provides measures for quantitative assessment of genome assembly, gene set, and transcriptome completeness

# Installation
conda create -n <your_env_name> -c conda-forge -c bioconda busco=5.7.1
conda activate <your_env_name>
# If conda takes a long time to solve the environment, 
# you can try using mamba instead of conda. 
# Mamba is a reimplementation of the conda package manager in C++.

conda install -c conda-forge mamba
mamba install -c conda-forge -c bioconda busco=5.7.1

# Installation of BUSCO requiresï¼š
# Python 3.3+ (2.7 is not supported from v4 onwards)
# BioPython
# Pandas
# BBMap for genome assembly statistics such as N50
# tBLASTn 2.2+ for eukaryotic genome and prokaryotic transcriptome modes
# Augustus 3.2+ for eukaryotic genome mode
# Metaeuk for eukaryotic genome and eukaryotic transcriptome modes
# Prodigal for prokaryotic genome mode
# HMMER3.1+ for all modes
# SEPP for the auto-select lineage pipeline
# R and ggplot2 for the plotting companion script

# Running BUSCO
busco \
-i [SEQUENCE_FILE in fasta format] \
-m [MODE: genome, proteins, transcriptome] \
# [OTHER OPTIONS]
-c \#CPU cores
--auto-lineage \
-o \
--augustus #etc. detail could be seen in the webpage.
