# Functional Annotation
# Functional annotation:The annotation of gene function depends on the prediction of gene structure in the previous step.
# Based on the prediction results, the translated protein sequences are extracted from the genome and compared with the mainstream databases for blastp to complete the functional annotation.
# # # GeneOntology database
# # # KEGG, biological pathway database (Gene, Pathway, Ligand).
# # # UniProt (Universal Protein Resource) protein sequence database.
# # # Interpro database of protein families, domains and functional sites.
