#Step 6.3
#Homolog annotation
Sequence comparisons were performed using known genes from related species to find homologous sequences.
On the basis of the homologous sequences, the gene structure was then predicted based on gene signals such as shear signals, start and stop codons.
The proteins of homologous species were compared back to the genome using TBlastn to get the candidate regions.
Accurate protein-nucleic acid matching using EXonerate to obtain splice sites.

RNA-seq assisted annotation
tophat comparison ---->cufflink transcript ----> TransDecoder
RNAseq data were subjected to tophat comparison.
The resultant file is used to construct transcripts using cufflink.
Use TransDecoder to predict Open Reading Frame (ORF) on the constructed transcripts.

Iso seq auxiliary annotation
CD-HIT ---->gmap comparison ---->TransDecoder
De-redundancy of three generations of full-length transcripts of the species using CD-HIT.
The redundant sequences were aligned back to the genome using gmap to obtain the transcript positions.
Use TransDecoder to predict Open Reading Frame (ORF) on the constructed transcripts.

MAKERE integration
MAKER is a powerful process for genome annotation.
MAKER is a powerful process that integrates Denovo, Homolog, and transcription-assisted annotation to ensure the reliability of the final annotated gene set.

maker maker_exe.ctl maker_opts.ctl maker_bopts.ctl
#maker exe.ct: path to the executable program
#maker_ boots.ctl: filter parameters for BLAST7 and Exonerate
#maker opts.ctl: other information, e.g. input genome files, major adjustments to input files, etc. ( genome= ;est= ;protein= ;pred_gff= ;)
