# Step2
# As the output is gfa format which is not supported by RagTag(a sofeware maps contigs to reference genome to get right path) 
# for get the fasta output
awk '/^S/{print ">"$2; printf "%s", $3 | "fold -w 80"; close("fold -w 80"); print ""}' in.gfa > out.fa
# If you want to include GFA tags in fasta header line
awk '/^S/{header=">"$2; for(i=4; i<=NF; i++) {header=header" "$i}; print header; printf "%s", $3 | "fold -w 80"; close("fold -w 80"); print ""}' in.gfa > out.fa
#close() is required to prevent the headers and sequences from getting out of sync or being skipped 
#when sequences are very long.

# Sometimes, one may need join contigs/segments together before exporting to fasta you should use a scaffolding tool such as:
# # #GraphUnzip (Detangles graph, can be used before scaffolding)
# # #DENTIST
# # #SAMBA
# # #ntLINK
# # #SLR
# # #SGTK
#However these is not necessary when you already have a reference genome of the same speices.

# A very good choice is too amplify a crossing population, especially in plants, construction of linkage maps will help you know the relative position of each contig
#If karyotype is known, better using FISH-or GISH to verify it by karyotype. Then the Unknow chromosome will be assign into right chromosome.
