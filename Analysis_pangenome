# Step 7 
# pan-genome analysis, this step is finding orthologues and draw Species Tree or Gene Trees
# OrthoFinder with the Markov clustering algorithm
# If you are interested in a single gene, SHOOT.bio is a choice: https://SHOOT.bio
#All the steps below should be done in linux system. If you are using Mac or Windows,try conda or docker
# Installation of OrhoFinder
Download the latest release from github: https://github.com/davidemms/OrthoFinder/releases
# Extract the files (If you have python installed and the numpy and scipy libraries )
tar xzf OrthoFinder_source.tar.gz 
# or (entire package)
tar xzf OrthoFinder.tar.gz
#Test of installation
python OrthoFinder_source/orthofinder.py -h
# or
./OrthoFinder/orthofinder -h
# Run example data, input files are at fasta format, with one file per species
# For example A.fasta B.faste C.fasta in the folder named ExampleData/
./OrthoFinder/orthofinder -f /OrthoFinder/ExampleData/
# To check the trees, 
# Dendroscope # software is a good choice
# The tree is saved in Species_Tree/SpeciesTree_rooted.txt.
# To root a tree, 
# The root of a phylogenetic tree is usually determined by using the outgroup method; 
# one or more of the species are assumed to fall outside of the species group of interest 
# (de- noted the ingroup) and the branch where the outgroup connects to the ingroup 
# becomes the root of the ingroup tree.
